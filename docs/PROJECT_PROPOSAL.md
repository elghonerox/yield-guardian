**Agent Arena University Hackathon Submission**  
**Date:** [Current Date]  
**Status:** Phase 2 - Project Proposal

---

## 1. Project Concept

### 1.1 Agent Name and Tagline

**Name:** YieldGuardian

**Tagline:** "Maximize your DeFi yields autonomously with risk-adjusted multi-protocol optimization"

**Category:** DeFi - Yield Optimization

**One-Line Description:**  
An autonomous AI agent that continuously monitors yields across multiple DeFi protocols, analyzes risk-adjusted returns, and automatically reallocates assets to maximize yields while maintaining user-defined risk profiles.

### 1.2 Problem Statement

**The Problem:**

DeFi users face significant challenges in yield optimization:

1. **Manual Monitoring Burden:**
   - Users must manually check yields across multiple protocols
   - Yields change frequently (every block, every minute)
   - Constant monitoring is time-consuming and impractical
   - Users miss opportunities while sleeping or away

2. **Yield Comparison Complexity:**
   - Different protocols use different metrics (APY, APR, etc.)
   - Risk factors vary significantly across protocols
   - Comparing apples to oranges (different risk profiles)
   - No unified view of opportunities

3. **Reallocation Friction:**
   - Manual reallocation is slow (by the time you act, opportunity may be gone)
   - Gas costs for frequent rebalancing
   - Transaction approval delays
   - Missed opportunities due to human delay

4. **Risk Management Gap:**
   - Most users focus only on highest yield
   - Ignore risk factors (volatility, smart contract risk, etc.)
   - No risk-adjusted optimization
   - Potential for significant losses despite high yields

5. **No Autonomous Solution:**
   - Existing tools require manual execution
   - Alerts but no autonomous action
   - Single-protocol focus
   - No risk-adjusted optimization

**Market Impact:**
- Millions of DeFi users managing billions in assets
- Billions in potential yield optimization
- Significant time savings for users
- Better risk-adjusted returns

## 5. Feasibility Assessment

### 5.1 Can This Be Built in 4 Weeks?

**Answer: Yes, with focused scope**

**Confidence Level:** Medium-High (70-80%)

**Key Factors Supporting Feasibility:**
1. **ADK-TS Framework:** Reduces development time significantly (estimated 30-40% time savings)
2. **Focused Scope:** MVP with core features only, not full production system
3. **Pre-trained Models:** Use existing AI/ML APIs (no training needed, saves 1-2 weeks)
4. **Well-Documented Protocols:** Frax, Aave, Compound have good documentation
5. **Team Capabilities:** TypeScript and blockchain experience reduces learning curve

**Key Risks:**
1. **Time Constraints:** 4 weeks is tight for quality work
2. **Multi-Protocol Integration:** Can be complex, each protocol different
3. **ATP Launch:** Process may be unclear or have issues
4. **Unexpected Issues:** Always possible in development

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Focus on core features (must-have only)
- Use well-documented tools and protocols
- Research ATP early (Week 1)
- Have fallback plans for each risk
- Prioritize working MVP over perfection

### 5.2 MVP Definition
