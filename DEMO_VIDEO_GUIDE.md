# Demo Video Guide - YieldGuardian

## Overview

This guide provides a script and production plan for the 5-minute demo video required for hackathon submission.

## Video Structure (5 Minutes Max)

### 0:00-0:30 - Hook & Problem (30 seconds)

**Script:**
"DeFi users face a critical challenge: manually monitoring yields across multiple protocols is time-consuming and inefficient. A 15-minute delay in rebalancing can cost significant yield opportunities. Today, I'll show you YieldGuardian - the first autonomous multi-protocol yield optimizer that solves this problem."

**Visual:**
- Show problem: Multiple browser tabs with different DeFi protocols
- Highlight the manual work required
- Show missed opportunities

### 0:30-1:30 - Agent Introduction (60 seconds)

**Script:**
"YieldGuardian is an autonomous AI agent built with ADK-TS that continuously monitors yields across Frax Finance, Aave, and Compound. It analyzes risk-adjusted returns and automatically reallocates assets to maximize yields while maintaining your risk profile. The agent operates 24/7, making decisions without human intervention."

**Visual:**
- Show agent architecture diagram
- Highlight autonomous capabilities
- Show key features

### 1:30-3:30 - Live Demo (120 seconds) - MOST IMPORTANT

**Script:**
"Let me show you YieldGuardian in action. Here's my wallet with assets currently in Aave earning 3.8% APY. Watch as the agent monitors yields across protocols... [pause] The agent has detected a better opportunity in Frax Finance at 4.5% APY with acceptable risk. It's now automatically rebalancing... [show transaction] And done! The agent has successfully reallocated assets, improving my yield by 0.7% APY. All without any manual intervention."

**Visual:**
- Screen recording of agent dashboard
- Show real-time monitoring
- Show decision-making process
- Show transaction execution
- Show results and improved yield

**Key Scenarios to Demonstrate:**

1. **Basic Yield Optimization:**
   - Show current position
   - Show agent detecting better opportunity
   - Show automatic rebalancing
   - Show improved yield

2. **Risk-Adjusted Optimization:**
   - Show high-yield but high-risk opportunity
   - Show agent choosing better risk-adjusted option
   - Show risk metrics

3. **Multi-Protocol Monitoring:**
   - Show agent monitoring multiple protocols simultaneously
   - Show cross-protocol comparison
   - Show optimal allocation

### 3:30-4:30 - Technical Highlights (60 seconds)

**Script:**
"YieldGuardian is built using ADK-TS, IQAI's Agent Development Kit. The framework provided rapid development with built-in blockchain integration and ATP tokenization support. We leveraged ADK-TS's AgentBuilder API, multi-LLM support for AI decision-making, and blockchain tools for protocol interactions. The agent showcases true autonomy with 24/7 operation and AI-powered decision-making."

**Visual:**
- Show code snippets (ADK-TS usage)
- Show architecture diagram
- Highlight ADK-TS features used
- Show ATP integration

### 4:30-5:00 - Impact & Future (30 seconds)

**Script:**
"YieldGuardian addresses a massive market opportunity - millions of DeFi users managing billions in assets. With clear revenue models and scalable architecture, this agent has significant investment potential. Post-hackathon, we plan to expand to additional protocols, add multi-chain support, and launch on mainnet. This is not just a hackathon project - it's a production-ready foundation for autonomous DeFi optimization."

**Visual:**
- Show market opportunity stats
- Show roadmap
- Show investment potential
- End with agent running autonomously

## Production Tips

1. **Audio:**
   - Use good microphone
   - Record in quiet environment
   - Test audio levels
   - Add background music (optional, low volume)

2. **Video:**
   - Screen recording in HD (1080p minimum)
   - Show agent dashboard clearly
   - Use annotations/highlights for key moments
   - Smooth transitions

3. **Editing:**
   - Keep pace energetic but clear
   - Add captions/subtitles
   - Highlight key moments
   - Professional transitions

4. **Upload:**
   - Upload to YouTube (unlisted or public)
   - Ensure video is accessible
   - Link in README and submission

## Key "Wow Factor" Moments

1. **Real-time Monitoring:** Show agent monitoring yields live
2. **Automatic Rebalancing:** Show transaction execution without human action
3. **Risk-Adjusted Decision:** Show agent choosing better risk-adjusted option
4. **Multi-Protocol Intelligence:** Show simultaneous monitoring of multiple protocols
5. **Results:** Show improved yields and performance
